This directory holds scripts for:
1. Running baseline experiments (running Dacapo for unmodified JikesRVM)
-> compared with 2 to determine the performance gain/loss

2. Running the Dacapo benchmark for Vincent (run_vincent_experiment.sh)
-> produce heatmaps comparing the energy, time, and edp of Vincent compared to 
the conventional Linux CPU governors.
